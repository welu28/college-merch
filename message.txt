Dear [School Name] admissions team,
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Wenhao Lu, and I am a rising junior in high school currently exploring colleges. After looking through your website, I was particularly interested in the CS/Engineering programs as well as the wide range of opportunities your school offers to students for academic excellence as well as personal growth.
I also saw online that some schools send t-shirts/merch to interested students, does your school offer anything like that?
Thanks!
Sincerely,
Wenhao Lu
