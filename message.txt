Dear [School Name] admissions team,
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Wenhao Lu, and I am a rising junior in high school currently exploring colleges. I have been exploring colleges that align with my goals and values, and [School Name] really stood out to me. After looking through your website, I was particularly interested in the wide variety of programs as well as the wide range of opportunities your school offers to students for academic excellence as well as personal growth. I'd love to learn more about everything that sets student life and academics at [School Name] apart.
I also saw online that some schools send t-shirts to interested students, does your school offer anything like that? I would appreciate any [School Name] merch you might have for prospective students, it would mean a lot to represent a school I'm excited about!
Thanks!
Sincerely,
Wenhao Lu
